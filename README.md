# BurnImagedetection

Here we trained the classifier to identify the image as burned or not burned.

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a classifier that can identify whether an image is burned or not. The classifier is trained using a dataset of images with labels indicating if the image is burned.

## Dataset
We used a dataset comprising images labeled as burned or not burned. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Training
The classifier is trained using machine learning techniques implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. The training process includes data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best results.

## Usage
To use the classifier, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/eswar94916/BurnImagedetection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd BurnImagedetection`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to train and test the classifier.
